# iTMDb

iTMDb is an Objective-C Cocoa wrapper (framework) for the [TMDb.org](http://tmdb.org/) v3.0 API. © Christian Rasmussen, 2010–2014.

This software is dual-licensed (pick either one you want): **MIT License** or **New BSD License**. See the `LICENSE` file. If you would like to use a different license, please contact me at code at devify dot dk.

iTMDb is developed for **Mac OS X** 10.7 Lion and up, but it should work fine with *iOS 5* and up.

You need Xcode 5.0 and LLVM Clang 5.0 or higher to build the project.

Please remember to read the TMDb API [Terms of Use](https://www.themoviedb.org/about/api-terms).

You can safely submit your apps using iTMDb to the App Store (it's been approved for use with [Collection](http://collectionapp.com/)). It fully supports OS X's sandboxing requirements.

## Documentation

Most of the classes are documented using [appledoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc). A generated copy of the documentation can be found [here](http://docs.apoltix.com/itmdb/). The documentation is also parseable by and usable in Xcode 5 and 6.

Certain classes have no specific documentation, but they are internal classes used by other classes, and are not intended to be interacted with directly.

The framework was built to be as easy and intuitive to use, so looking at the header files should give you an idea of how it is structured. Please see the test application (available in the Xcode project) for code samples.

## How to use

You can check out the included test project (`iTMDbTest`) within the Xcode workspace for an example of how to use the framework. All iTMDb classes are prefixed with `TMDB`, and the main class, just called `TMDB`, is known as the "context" in many API calls.

1. Add the framework to your project like any other framework (use Google if you don't know how to do this).

2. Add a Copy Files build phase to your project that puts the framework into the target's Frameworks folder.

3. Add the following line to the header (or source) files where you will be using iTMDb:

	``` objective-c
	 #import <iTMDb/iTMDb.h>
	```

4. You create an instance of iTMDb like this. Replace ``api_key`` with your own API key, provided by [TMDb](http://api.themoviedb.org/). iTMDb performs fetch requests asynchronously, so setting a delegate is required. The delegate will receive notifications when the loading is done. The object should follow the TMDBDelegate protocol.

	``` objective-c
	TMDB *tmdb = [[TMDB alloc] initWithAPIKey:@"api_key" delegate:self];
	```

5. Look up a movie (while knowing it's id).

	``` objective-c
	[TMDBMovie movieWithID:22538 options:TMDBMovieFetchOptionAll context:tmdb];
	```

6. An API request is made. Once information has been downloaded, the context object (`tmdb`) will receive a notification. The fetched properties are available through the returned object, which is sent to the context delegate (`tmdb.delegate`) with the following method:

	``` objective-c
	-[tmdb:(TMDB *)context didFinishLoadingMovie:(TMDBMovie *)movie]
	```

	Set the movie's title to a text field:

	``` objective-c
	-[movieTitleTextField setStringValue:movie.title];
	```

## Integration

iTMDb uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).

If you need to integrate the source directly into your project that is not using ARC, you can specify the ``-fobjc-arc`` compiler flag for each ``.m`` file in the *Compile Sources* section of the *Build Phases* tab of the target.

## Dependencies

There are no third-party dependencies; only system-available Apple frameworks are used in iTMDb.

## What's missing

iTMDb does not cover the entire TMDb API, and only movie search and lookup works – including Cast & Crew and Posters. Things like authentication is not implemented.

If you are up for it, feel free to develop on the framework and submit a pull request.
